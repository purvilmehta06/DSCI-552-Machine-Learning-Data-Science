## Note
1. This project is entirely done on Google Colab with GPU enabled. 
2. There may be some issues regarding dependencies written in requirements.txt

## Instruction on how to run
1. Open google colab and upload ```notebook/Mehta_Purvil_Project.ipynb```. 
2. Create a folder in the same gmail account's drive with a name ```ML Project```. Make sure this folder is just under a folder ```MyDrive```.
3. Upload ```data``` folder inside ```ML Project```. 
4. File structure should look like this: 
```
MyDrive
    - ML Project
        - data
            - Data
                - Sport Images
                - Sport Videos
            - Pre-trained Weights
            - Stats
```
5. Time to run!! (You can use pre-trained weights or try to train these models from scratch!)
